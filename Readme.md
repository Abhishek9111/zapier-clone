# End-to-End Backend Clone using Kafka, Postgres, Node, and Next.js

This project is an end-to-end backend system clone that leverages Kafka for event streaming, Postgres for database management, Node.js for server-side logic, and Next.js for the frontend. It serves as a comprehensive example of integrating these technologies to build a robust and scalable backend system.

## How to Start the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running on your machine
- Node.js and npm installed

### Step 1: Start Prisma Locally

Run the following command to start a Postgres container:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword postgres
```

### Step 2: Start Kafka Locally

Run the following command to start a Kafka container:

```bash
docker run -p 9092:9092 apache/kafka:3.7.1
```

### Step 3: Create Kafka Topic

1. Fetch the Kafka container ID:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. Bash into the Kafka container:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <kafka_container_id> /bin/bash
   ```

3. Once in the shell mode, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/kafka/bin
   ./kafka-topics.sh --create --topic zap-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up Prisma

Navigate to the primary-backend repository and run the following commands to set up Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

Repeat `npx prisma generate` in all backend-associated repositories(don't run migrate dev at other places).

To prefill the database with static data, run (inside the primary-backend repo ):

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### Step 5: Run Development Servers

Run the development servers for each component:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Primary Backend
- Frontend
- Processor
- Hooks
- Worker
